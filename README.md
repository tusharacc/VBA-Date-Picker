# VBA-Date-Picker
Macro to create Date Picker

Excel 2003 had a feature “Date Time Picker”. Date time picker was a GUI way of selecting a date in excel, but from Excel-2007 onwards for some weird reason the feature was removed.

In excel 2007, date time picker can be installed by copying mscomct2.ocx from microsoft’s site and registering it, but what if the excel will be used in different system that has the file missing?

For one of the tool that I was developing, I faced the same question and decided to create a user form to select a date. This post is about how to use and customize the code to suit the need of individual developers.
